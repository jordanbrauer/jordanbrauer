(￣▽￣)ノ <sup>— hello !</sup>

My name is Jordan, and I guess you could say that I am a [software developer](https://etiennefd.substack.com/p/common-tech-jobs-described-as-cabals). Currently I am leading a small team at [Neo Financial](https://www.neofinancial.com/), working on our [PaaS products](https://www.neofinancial.com/for-business/platform-as-a-service). I also occasionally stream over [on Twitch](https://www.twitch.tv/jordanbrauer) where I attempt to build [_Minibase_](https://www.minibase.art) in public.

If you want to learn more, you can read [my blog](https://blog.jordanbrauer.dev) and find other, potentially interesting things over at my website, [`jordanbrauer.dev`](https://www.jordanbrauer.dev), but don't hold your breath. Seriously.
