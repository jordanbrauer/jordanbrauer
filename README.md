(￣▽￣)ノ <sup>— hello !</sup>

My name is Jordan, and I guess you could say that I am a [software developer](https://etiennefd.substack.com/p/common-tech-jobs-described-as-cabals). Currently, I am working on DX with a team at [Finch](https://www.tryfinch.com/), focusing on our developer dashboard, [documentation](https://developer.tryfinch.com/), sandbox, [SDKs](https://github.com/Finch-API), and auth flow for connecting HRIS and ATS systems to Finch.

If you want to learn more, you can read [my blog](https://blog.jordanbrauer.dev) and find other, potentially interesting things over at my website, [`jordanbrauer.dev`](https://www.jordanbrauer.dev), but don't hold your breath. Seriously.
